# A Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise

Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class iden- tification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large da- tabases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solu- tion to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to dis- cover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an ap- propriate value for it
